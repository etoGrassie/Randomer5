# Randomer5

#### Introduction

Randomer Project is a random numbers generator. It is used for teaching and class.

Randomer5 is powerful and easy to use.

Randomer5 is based on C++, and not Python which the old versions are based on.

This repo is also available on Gitee -> [Randomer5](https://gitee.com/etoGrassie/Randomer5/)

#### Versions

Randomer4 is based on Python 3.8.10, and Randomer2 and Randomer2.1 are based on Python 3.7.2.

Now, we support Randomer5 and Randomer4. Remember that the older versions are not supported.

From July 2022, we started to use new version naming convention:

- Release (after a feature-update)：`v5.x`
- Fixed (after fixing a bug)：`v5.x.x`
- Beta (may not work well)：`v5.x-beta`
